I am a 23 year-old Senior Airman in the United States Air Force,
working as a Java Enterprise Web Developer for a training records
management system.  I am stationed in Montgomery, Alabama with my
wife Kailey, golden retriever-lab mix Roxy, and American Shorthair
cat Belmont.

I have been working on enterprise software systems for around
3-and-a-half years, and have found a lot of job satisfaction
from it.  I also dabble in game programming as a hobby, and
most enjoy working on game engine modules, such as graphics
and physics engines.  As a "technology enthusiast," I often
spend hours getting lost in studying and coding with new
languages or APIs.  While I am most comfortable with the Java
programming language, as it is the language in which I am
most experienced, my favorite languages to code in are C and
C++.

In addition to being a developer, I have also had the pleasure
of being a Java trainer for over two years.  This has been a
role I have thoroughly enjoyed. Not only does it allow me to
help shape the development of junior developers, it makes
me a stronger developer myself, as I have the opportunity to
break down concepts I often take for granted and challenge
myself to always ensure I am qualified to train these new
developers.

When I don't have my nose in code or technical manuals, I am
also a gamer, reader, and all-too-frequent Internet stumbler.
